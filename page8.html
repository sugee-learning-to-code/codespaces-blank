    <h1>Welcome to my life</h1>
    <p>Enjoy this small timeline of my life. Here you can see everything from the moment I was born to the future. There are many events or experiences that shape our life. I wanted to share these six experiences with you. I do want to say that Iâ€™ve experienced a lot more in my life but that is a long story and also I thought that six of these boxes were enough. </p>
    <p>Feel free to click on all the events to enjoy some lovely pictures.</p>
    <p>ps: you have a lot of influence on the last box "the future". I need to pass</p>
