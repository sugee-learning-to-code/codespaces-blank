This project is my sketchbook and my free space for learning to code. Coming into this project, I only knew the basics of HTML & CSS code, so I wanted to push myself to learn more of these two languages and combine them with Javascript. I have never worked with Javascript before so I also wanted to jump into this language which is honestly way harder than I imagined. Coming into this project, I didn't know anything about Javascript and honestly, it's such a headful, and very hard to understand in the beginning. I started looking up beginner-friendly Javascript projects that I can work on. I made a list of the most interesting ones and put them all on the website "my sketchbook". This combined with HTML and CSS turned into a pretty fun website that I'm pretty proud of.  
This website "Sketchbook" includes various Javascript projects. The website is designed in a way, especially for my teacher that is going to grade me. The purpose of this website is to take my teacher on my journey of learning how to code.
